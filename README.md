article.php - function printArticle
Remember that you should avoid printing text in a function.

article.php:8 - Remember that you could use === here to avoid a string.

functions.php:11 - I would've moved the require outside the function and include the data as an argument.

data.php:published_date - Different formattings on the dates. And I would've a space between - and the date.

index.php:36-43 - Remember that you can use <?= which is the same as <?php echo

article.php: I would've added some padding on the title and content.

Overall a really great job!
